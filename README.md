## Problem Statement
A recurring problem in e-commerce is classifying customers according to their value to the company. One of the practices used in the business world to determine this is the RFM (Recence, Frequency, Monetization) table.

The case study addressed is an E-commerce that has approximately 5 thousand customers in its database, it wants to identify the best ones to forward them to the loyalty program.

## Objective
**Main:**
* Create clusters according to the customer's RFM without using any machine learning models, using only statistical theory.
* Create clusters according to the customer's RFM using some machine learning models then compare them with the previous result.
* Indicate the company's best clients for a loyalty plan.
